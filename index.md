# ML and (Quantum) Physics Journal Club

This is an online journal club that discusses topics at the interface of machine learning and (quantum) physics.

## Format

The format is informal, and based on:
* 1-hour long weekly meetings (date to be determined)
* 1-2 major research topics per semester to keep the discussion focussed
* 1 topic for an in-depth tutorial (e.g., some recent ML method/technique) 
* weekly presentations are given by: 
    * invited external speakers (students/postdocs with interesting preprints)
    * internal speakers: students/postdocs from the group to present
    * a paper of their own choice on the topics
    * a paper suggested by the group
    * (parts of) a review/textbook as a tutorial
